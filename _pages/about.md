<span style="font-size: 8px; font-family: 'Arial';">
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, supervised by Prof. Gerald Penn. I completed my undergraduate degree at UofT as well, where I was awarded the **Rose Sheinin Award** (UofT's highest-performing female student graduating from a science program) and was nominated for the **Governor General’s Silver Medal** (highest academic standing at the UofT).</span>

My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical linguistics and efficient LLM. Specifically:

- Categorial Grammar and formal languages 
- Efficient LLM training, including:
  - Distributed systems and infrastructure
  - Parameter-efficient fine-tuning
  - Long-context modeling
  - Lightweight Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models

I’m currently exploring RL, as I believe RLHF and robotics hold potential for the future.

I’m also an educational content creator focused on research papers sharing and explaining AI concepts to a broader audience. I have over **7,000+** followers, and most of my followers are STEM university students around the world.
