    I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, supervised by Prof. Gerald Penn. I completed my undergraduate degree at UofT as well, where I was awarded the <strong>Rose Sheinin Award</strong> (UofT's highest-performing female science student) and was nominated for the <strong>Governor General’s Silver Medal</strong> (highest academic standing at the UofT).

  My research interests lie primarily in:
  <br>• Categorial Grammar and Formal Language
  <br>• Efficient LLM training, including:
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Distributed systems and infrastructure  
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Parameter-efficient fine-tuning  
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Long-context modeling  
  <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• Lightweight Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures
  <br>• Safety/Fairness in AI
</p>

  <p>
    I’m currently exploring RL, as I believe RLHF and robotics hold potential for the future.

    I’m also an educational content creator focused on research paper sharing and explaining AI concepts to a broader audience. I have over <strong>7,000+</strong> followers, and most of them are STEM university students around the world.
