<div style="font-size: 8px; font-family: 'Arial';">
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, supervised by Prof. Gerald Penn. I completed my undergraduate degree at UofT as well, where I was awarded the <strong>Rose Sheinin Award</strong> (UofT's highest-performing female student graduating from a science program) and was nominated for the <strong>Governor General’s Silver Medal</strong> (highest academic standing at the UofT).

My research interests lie at the intersection of theoretical linguistics and efficient LLM. Specifically:

<ul>
  <li>Categorial Grammar and formal languages</li>
  <li>Efficient LLM training, including:
    <ul>
      <li>Distributed systems and infrastructure</li>
      <li>Parameter-efficient fine-tuning</li>
      <li>Long-context modeling</li>
      <li>Lightweight Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

I’m currently exploring RL, as I believe RLHF and robotics hold potential for the future.

I’m also an educational content creator focused on research paper sharing and explaining AI concepts to a broader audience. I have over <strong>7,000+</strong> followers, and most of them are STEM university students around the world.
