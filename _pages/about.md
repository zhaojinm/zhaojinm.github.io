<div style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Arial';">
I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Toronto, supervised by Prof. Gerald Penn. I completed my undergraduate degree at UofT as well, where I was awarded the <strong>Rose Sheinin Award</strong> (UofT's highest-performing female student graduating from a science program) and was nominated for the <strong>Governor General’s Silver Medal</strong> (highest academic standing at the UofT).

<br><br>

My research interests lie primarily in Categorial Grammar and efficient LLM training from multiple perspectives, including distributed systems, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, long-context modeling, and lightweight Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures.

I’m currently exploring RL, as I believe RLHF and robotics hold potential for the future.

<br>

I’m also an educational content creator focused on research paper sharing and explaining AI concepts to a broader audience. I have over <strong>7,000+</strong> followers, and most of them are STEM university students around the world.
